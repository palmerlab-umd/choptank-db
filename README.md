# Choptank database

This website contains links and information for interacting with the Choptank Hydrologic Connectivity database, which uses the [ODM2](http://www.odm2.org/) framework and is an ongoing collaboration between several lab groups at the University of Maryland and Virginia Tech. Contact [Kelly Hondula](https://github.com/khondula) for more information. 

### How-to

1. [Connecting to the database](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/connect.html): connecting to database, listing tables, getting info about tables, simple queries

*Sites*

1. [Add sampling sites to the database](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/insert-samplingfeatures.html): 
read in a google earth kmz file and add point locations as sites to the sampling features table

1. [Map all sites in database](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/read-samplingfeatures.html): retrieve records from samplingfeatures table and make a map

1. [Add relationships between sampling features](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/relate-samplingfeatures.html)

1. [Add a new annotation about a group of sites](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/insert-site-annotations.html)

*Data from point measurements in the field*

1. [Insert soil moisture measurements from TDR probe](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/insert-sm-data.html)

1. water depth and/or inundation extent

*Results associated with samples and lab analyses* 

1. Dissolved gas measurements: 
    * [Add samples with PPM data](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/db-insert-hs-ppms.html)
    * [Calculate and add concentration data](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/db-insert-hs-umols.html)

1. Record that a sample was taken at a site
1. Soil properties
1. Microbial data
