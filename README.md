1. [Add sampling sites to the database](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/insert-samplingfeatures.html): 
read in a google earth kmz file and add point locations as sites to the sampling features table

1. [Map all sites in database](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/read-samplingfeatures.html): retrieve records from samplingfeatures table and make a map

1. [Add relationships between sampling features](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/relate-samplingfeatures.html)

1. [Add sample results](https://palmerlab-umd.github.io/choptank-db/insert-sample-results.html): add results from samples with one value in the results

# Wetland observations

Are you making a wetland visit? Here are some things to potentially take note of:

| Category    | Levels                  |  Description                        |

| pond scum   |  | note the color, intensity, coverage of surfactants on water surface if present |
| water depth | soggy, puddling, above ankles, above boots, above hip waders  | |
| water temperature | | |
| leaves | | things about leaf fall |
| color of water |  | let's get a secchi disk!   |
| vegetation | emergent vegetation, sphagnum mats, trees in wetland center | maybe add how dense it is and how patchy/diverse |
| surface flow features |  | is surface water present/flowing into or out of wetland, are there defined inlets/outlets |
| canopy | | open, semi-open, or closed canopy | 
| sediment deposition | | how silty is the bottom |
| bubbles | | none, some, many bubbles created when walking through wetland, sulfur (or other) smells when sediment is disturbed |
| critters | | any animals observed |
